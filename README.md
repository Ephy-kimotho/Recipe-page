### BUILT WITH

- Semantic HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Flex box

### WHAT I HAVE LEARNT
In this project I have learnt how to write semantic HTML5. I have also learnt how to give descriptive class names to HTML elements. I learnt how to use CSS pseudo classes so style the 
list's marker and the last table row.

For example to remove border on the last row:
```CSS
tr:last-of-type{
    border-bottom: none;
}
```
